There are two ways to install **Fym**.

Manual installation (recommended)
=================================

As **Fym** is the ongoing project, many changes are expected in the short time.
We periodically upload stable versions to [PyPi](https://pypi.org), but if you
want to use the latest features of **Fym** development, we recommend installing
**Fym** manually, as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/fdcl-nrf/fym.git
   $ cd fym
   $ pip install -e .

Note that `master` branch contains all the latest features that can be used
immediately as the default development branch.

Install with PyPi
=================

If you want to install the most stable version of **Fym** uploaded in PyPi, you
can do it:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install fym
